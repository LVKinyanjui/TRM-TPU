# TPU v5e is much faster than a T4 GPU. 
# You can likely increase the global_batch_size to 1024 or 2048 
# to keep the TPU cores fully utilized.
global_batch_size: 1024 

# On TPU, we often prefer a slightly longer warmup 
# because the initial compilation steps can be intense.
lr_warmup_steps: 5000 

# Keep EMA False for your first test run. 
# Once you verify the speed is good, flip it to True.
